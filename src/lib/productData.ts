      answer:
        "Vedsutra Detox Foot Patches are premium natural wellness patches designed to support your body's detoxification and weight loss journey. Made with a blend of Ayurvedic ingredients, they work overnight to draw out toxins, heavy metals, and impurities through the reflexology points on your feet, helping you achieve natural fat loss and complete body detoxification.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do the patches work for weight loss?",
      answer:
        "The patches work through multiple mechanisms: they help eliminate excess water weight, boost metabolism through improved circulation, support the body's natural detoxification process which can aid in fat metabolism, and help reduce bloating. Combined with a healthy lifestyle, they can significantly support your weight loss goals.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are the patches safe to use regularly?",
      answer:
        "Yes! Vedsutra foot patches are made with 100% natural ingredients and are completely safe for regular use. We recommend using them 2-3 times per week for optimal results. However, if you have sensitive skin or any medical conditions, please consult with your healthcare provider before use.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why do the patches change color?",
      answer:
        "The patches darken as they absorb toxins, moisture, and impurities from your body. This color change is a visible indicator that the patches are working. The darker the patch becomes, the more toxins have been drawn out. This is completely normal and expected.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long should I use the patches?",
      answer:
        "For best results, we recommend using the patches consistently for at least 4-6 weeks. Many users continue using them as part of their regular wellness routine. You can use them 2-3 times per week or as needed based on your wellness goals.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use these patches if I have diabetes or other health conditions?",
      answer:
        "While our patches are made with natural ingredients, if you have diabetes, circulatory issues, or any other medical conditions, we strongly recommend consulting with your healthcare provider before using the patches to ensure they're appropriate for your specific situation.",
    },

All ingredients are 100% natural and carefully selected for their effectiveness.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly will I see results?",
      answer:
        "Many users notice improved sleep and energy levels within the first week. Weight loss and detoxification benefits typically become more noticeable after 2-3 weeks of consistent use. Results vary based on individual factors like body composition, lifestyle, and consistency of use.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to change my diet or exercise?",
      answer:
        "While the patches work on their own, combining them with a balanced diet and regular exercise will enhance your results significantly. The patches support your body's natural processes, making it easier to achieve your wellness goals when combined with a healthy lifestyle.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any side effects?",
      answer:
